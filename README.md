# E-Commerce User Retention Analysis (Cohort Method)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer retention for an online retail business using **Cohort Analysis**. By tracking user behavior from their first transaction (acquisition) over time, we evaluate the business's ability to retain customers versus its ability to acquire new ones.

The analysis distinguishes between **Transactional Volume** (Cohort Size) and **User Loyalty** (Retention Rate) to provide a holistic view of business health.

## Tech Stack
* **Python 3.10**
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)

## Key Insights
1.  **Retention Rate (Quality):** The business demonstrates strong product-market fit with a healthy **~35% retention rate** for established cohorts after 12 months.
2.  **Acquisition Trend (Quantity):** Despite high loyalty, new user acquisition has **dropped significantly** (from ~600 to <70 monthly users) throughout the analysis period, signaling a need for top-of-funnel marketing revitalization.

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  Place your dataset (`Online Retail Data.csv`) in the root directory.
4.  Run the notebook `Retention_Analysis.ipynb`.
